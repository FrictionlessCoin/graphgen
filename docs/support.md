## Thank you for your interest in #Graphgen

*Graphgen* is open-source and will stay. A lot of evolutions are also planned.

The project is a personal project that is targeted to the Neo4j community, done outside of my work environment.

If you would like to support me in this project, I can accept donations via Paypal, also I'm a big fan of Stickers and 
Open Source projects T-Shirts and lastly here is my [Amazon Wishlist](http://www.amazon.fr/registry/wishlist/1B1RCR7ZB36Z2)

If you have any question you can always ping me via email *chris (at) neoxygen (dot) io*

Thank you and as a last word *Neo4j Rocks !*
