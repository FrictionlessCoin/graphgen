# Introduction

Need to have quickly a demo graph ? Helping people on forums and you want to quickly prototype an approximate related
to the question ? Want to show the power of Neo4j ?

`Graphgen` is what you're looking for !

---


## What is it ?

Graphgen is a graph generation engine based on the `Cypher` specification. It creates nodes and relationships in accordance
with your schema definition and can also generate fake property values.

---

## Rapid prototyping

You need to write only a few lines to generate complex graphs.

Look at the following example :

```cypher
(person:Person {name: fullName} *35)-[:WORKS_AT *n..1]->(comp:Company {name: company} *10)
(person)-[:KNOWS *n..n]->(person)
```

Here we've defined that we want 35 Person nodes having a name property that will be generated, we also describe that these persons
works for one company, and that there are 7 companies.

Also, each person can know each other to implement a social like graph.

After clicking on the **Generate** button, you'll get your graph visualization.

## Export features

You can export your graph in multiple formats or load it in a database, the available options are :

* export to GraphJson
* export to CypherQueries for usage on the Neo4j console or in the shell
* create a Neo4j console setup with your graph and open it
* load your graph in a publicly accessible database or even in your local database through the app


Discover how to describe your schema by reading the next sections.




### Quick how-to

The documentation is in write up, you can find here a quick overview of the possibilites.

#### Defining your nodes

First you start by defining a node and assigning an identifier, a label and the amount of nodes you would like to create :

```cypher
(p:Person *35)
```

This will create 35 nodes with the `Person` label.

Note:

* The identifier is mandatory
* The `*35` is the desired amount of Person nodes. You can omit it and it will default to 1 node.

#### Defining relationships

Defining relationships is as easy as defining nodes and the syntax try to stay close to the `Cypher Query Language`.

You need to define the `type` of the relationship and the cardinality :

```cypher
(p:Person *35)
(c:Company *10)
(p)-[:KNOWS *n..n]->(p)
(p)-[:WORKS_AT *n..1]->(c)
```

This will create 35 `Person` nodes, 10 `Company` nodes and a relationship between persons and companies (here a person works
for only on company, but a company can have multiple persons working for them) and also multiple relationships between persons.



You can see in the above example the reuse of identifiers.

#### Defining properties

Having such a graph schema does not match the reality, in fact `Persons` have a firstname, a lastname and a dateOfBirth and
`Companies` have a name and a description.

You can add properties to your nodes and relationships, real world name values will be generated for you.

Currently, a non exhaustive list is available at the end of this page.

If you want to know the available faker types names that you can use you should look at the README of the
[faker library](https://github.com/fzaninotto/faker).

The documentation will be improved in the next days with the list of available types, also graphgen will provide their own types.

To define a property, you should give it a key, let's say `firstname` , then you assign it a type, here `firstName`.

```cypher
(p:Person {firstname: firstName} *35)
(c:Company {name: company, description: catchPhrase} *10)
```

If you need to use a type that accept arguments, you'll need to embed the type and arguments between new { } .

```cypher
(p:Person {firstname: firstName, birhdate: {dateOfBirth: ["-65 years", "-18 years"] }} *35)
```

For the example here, people are working for a company, so I wanted to make sure their date of birth is in a legal age for
working and before the retiring age (currently 65 in Belgium).

The same applies for relationships.

### Other features

- Live import to any accessible database

- Export to GraphJSON format file

- Export to Cypher Queries Import file
